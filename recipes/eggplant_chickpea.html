        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Tbs Avocado oil</li>
            <li>1c Yellow onion, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>1 Tbs Garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1 Tbs Ginger, minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Tbs Spice blend</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Cut eggplants in half lengthwise. Score the flesh in a crosshatch pattern, being careful not to cut through the skin. Brush the cut sides with 1 tablespoon of avocado oil and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place the eggplants cut side down on the prepared baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the flesh is tender and golden brown.</li>
            <li>While the eggplants are roasting, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of avocado oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté for 5-7 minutes, or until softened and translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped garlic and minced ginger to the skillet and cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning.</li>
            <li>Add the spice blend to the skillet and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly to toast the spices and release their flavors.</li>
            <li>Add the canned tomatoes (with their juice) to the skillet. Use a spoon to break up the tomatoes into smaller pieces. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked chickpeas to the tomato sauce and stir to combine. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes to heat through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Once the eggplants are roasted, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly. Use a spoon to scoop out some of the flesh, creating a cavity for the chickpea mixture.</li>
            <li>Spoon the chickpea mixture into the cavities of the roasted eggplants, dividing it evenly among them.</li>
            <li>Serve the stuffed eggplants hot, garnished with fresh cilantro or parsley if desired. Enjoy!</li>
